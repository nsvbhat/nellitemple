        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are many forms 
          of offerings that can be made to <b>Lord Shri Somanatheshwara</b> at 
          Nellitheertha. The sevas can be in the form of <b>Pooja</b> <i>(worship)</i>, 
          <b>Yagna</b><i> (fire ritual)</i>, <b>Bhajane</b> <i>(singing devotional 
          songs)</i> or even just a visit and prayer. The most often conducted 
          sevas and their descriptions are here below.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Shatha Rudrabhisheka: 
          </b>This literally means a bath involving 100 pots of water. Our scriptures 
          suggest that Lord Shiva is fond of water. It is because of this fondness 
          that we find river Ganga flowing from Lord Shiva's head. It is said 
          that the easiest way to please Lord Somanatha is to shower him with 
          water. Shatha Rudrabhisheka involves a mix of 100 pot-shower and Mangalarathis 
          amidst the chanting of Rudra Suktha by 11 purohits. At the end, there 
          is a grand Mangalarathi for the Lord.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Ekadasha Rudrabhisheka: 
          </b>This is a smaller scale version of the Shatha Rudrabhisheka where 
          11 pots of water are offered to Lord Shiva followed by a grand Mangalarathi. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><img src="images/seva.jpg" width="350" height="263" align="right">Ganapati 
          Homa: </b>This is a very famous yagna performed to please Lord Ganapati. 
          The rituals include offering all the favorite eateries of Lord Ganapati 
          consisting of a dish made of sugarcane, jaggery, bananas, black til 
          and ghee. The offerings are placed in the fire itself and is routed 
          through Agni Deva, the God of fire (according to the Vedas, all offerings 
          made through Yagnas are routed through Agni Deva). </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Ranga Pooja:</b> 
          This is a very special and colorful pooja offered to the Lord. Offerings 
          are placed on wooden racks in front of the Lord and lamps are lit throughout 
          the temple. This is also one of the most ritualistic poojas offered 
          at Nellitheertha.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Satyanarayana 
          Pooja:</b> Once every month, on the full moon day, people from the village 
          gather and perform a community Satyanarayana Pooja.This is also a social 
          occasion which lets people get together. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Durga Namaskara 
          Pooja:</b> This pooja is very unique to South Kanara and involves worshipping 
          Lord Shri Durga Parameshwari in the form of light. A lamps is placed 
          in the midst of a colorful Rangoli and is decorated with flowers and 
          jewellery. It is a treat to the eyes and is performed often at the temple.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Bhoota Nemas: 
          </b>This is also popularly known as Bhoota Kola. It is a dance ritual 
          offered to the Bhootas where a person assumes the role of a particular 
          Bhoota and dances throughout the night trying to please the Bhoota. 
          This is also a very ritualistic seva and is revered throughout South 
          Kanara. Kolas are unique to South Kanara and every temple with either 
          Lord Shiva or Lord Shakti as the deity has this ritual.</font></p>
