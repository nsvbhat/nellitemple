        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The holy place Nellitheertha 
          and the temple have a long and glorious history. Although the first 
          recorded material mentioning Nellitheertha dates back to <b>1487 A.D</b>, 
          there is ample evidence available at the place to suggest that the temple 
          existed much before that. At its glorious peak, there used to be daily 
          festivities performed under the aegis of the ruler of Nellitheertha. 
          From that grand state, the temple gradually declined and its existence 
          itself was threatened towards the later part of the twentieth century. 
          Since then, devotees and well wishers have got together to restore the 
          temple to its previous grandeur. With the blessings of <b>Shri Somanatha</b>, 
          the temple renovation work is now on in full swing.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">In 
          the state of Karnataka and indeed in entire India, the South Kanara 
          district occupies a unique place. The evergreen forests, amazing flora 
          and fauna, the numerous temples and places of worship and monuments 
          all make this district a huge attraction. The lifestyle of the people 
          here exemplifies the concept of unity in diversity. For the people of 
          Dakshina Kannada, art worship is a means of reaching the God and enriching 
          the culture of the land. Naturally, therefore, one can observe the people 
          seeing God in everything they do. Throughout the land, beautiful caves 
          and lakes have become centers of spiritual and religious significance. 
          Also, this land has given a multitude of scholars, artists, kings and 
          other great contributors to the nation.</font></font></p>

          the Nellitheertha region was under the administration of the Chowta 
          family. The chowtas are a famous name in Tulu Naadu and it is said that 
          the temple flourished under their administration and was a major center 
          for religious and cultural activities under their reign. Even today, 
          the descendants of the chowta clan take an active interest in the maintenance 
          and development of the temple.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are some artifacts 
          and archeological evidence available at the temple which point to a 
          Jain interest and influence at the temple. These are evidence to suggest 
          that the temple and the region was probably under the administration 
          of Jain kings of the region.</font></p>
