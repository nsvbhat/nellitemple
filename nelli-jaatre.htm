        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Every year, around 
          the last week of December, the Nellitheertha temple conducts its annual 
          Jaatre <i>(festival)</i>. This is a grand five day event full of religious 
          and cultural ceremonies. One thing that strikes a visitor to the Jaatre 
          is the sheer number of rituals and ceremonies associated with this event. 
          Though it may appear superstitious to the <i>"non-believer"</i>, it 
          is a fascinating experience. Simpy put, the Jaatre is the instrument 
          the villagers use to express their gratitude and respect to the Gods 
          and Bhootas. They offer their prayers to the Gods and Bhootas and seek 
          their continued protection and pray for good rains and harvests year 
          after year.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The festival starts 
          on the 14th day of the Shukla Paksha in Dhanur Maasa. Typically, this 
          falls on the last week of December or the first week of January. The 
          festival begins with a silver flag being hoisted to indicate the beginning 
          of the Jaatre. This is called <b>"Kodi"</b> or <b>"Dhwajaarohana"</b> 
          ceremony. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Each of the four 
          days has separate ceremonies like the <b>"Balis"</b> where the idol 
          of the presiding deity is carried around the temple for a procession 
          accompanied by music, the <b>"Rudrabhishekas"</b> where the Shiva Lingam 
          is given a grand shower with 101 vessels of water and the <b>"Rathotsava"</b> 
          where the deity is taken on a procession on the chariot.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images/fest.jpg" width="350" height="313" align="left">The 
          climax of the festival is on the fourth day. Called the <i>"Aarat"</i> 
          in local language, the ceremonies on this day mark the end of the festival. 
          During the day, the presiding deity is taken on a procession in the 
          Ratha or the chariot. Villagers offer their prayers during the procession. 
          There is also an event called as the Pilchandi Bheti <i>(meeting of 
          Pili-Chamundi with the Lord)</i> where the Bhoota offers its prayers 
          to the Lord during the procession and seeks his blessings and vows to 
          carry on the role of protecting Dharma in the region. The rituals are 
          followed by a grand lunch for one and all. The food on this day is considered 
          as God’s prasadam and no one leaves without having some.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rest of the 
          ceremonies start late in the evening and goes on till dawn next day. 
          The deity is taken on a procession and villagers offer <i>"Katte Pooje"</i> 
          or <i>"Platform Pooja" </i>to the deity as it passes their residence. 
          The deity is taken to the temple pond and is given a bath there. Devotees 
          also take bath along with the deity as its considered extremely sacred 
          to do so. On the return journey to the temple, again, several Katte 
          Poojes are offered. Finally, the flag is brought down to indicate the 
          closure of the festival.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The next day, respect 
          is offered to the Bhootas in the form of the Bhoota Kola. This is a 
          dance ritual where a man assumes the role of a Bhoota and performs a 
          set of rituals. It is believed that the Bhoota enters the body of the 
          person during the Kola. Locals revere the ceremony a lot and the word 
          of the person, performing the dance, during the kola is considered law. 
          Even today, local disputes are settled during the Kola. The grandest 
          of all Bhoota kolas is that of the <i>"Pili Chamundi"</i> Bhoota. It 
          is a treat to the eyes what with the variety of colors on display. The 
          kolas start early in the evening and continue till dawn the next day.</font></p>
