        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The main deity of 
          the temple is <b>Sri Somanatheshwara</b> <i>(Shiva)</i>. The temple 
          also has MahaGanapati <i>(Elephant - headed God) </i>and Jabali Maharshi 
          as deities here. In fact, the Jabali Maharshi Brindavana was recently 
          constructed. In typical Tulu-naadu<i> (Tulu is the native language in 
          this part of the woods)</i> tradition, the temple also has its set of 
          <b>"Bhootas"</b>. Bhootas are considered as the <b>"Ganas" </b>or warrior-assistants 
          of the Gods. According to mythology, bhootas are appointees of Shiva 
          and they administer the temple/village. The main bhootas of the Nellitheertha 
          temple are Pili-Chamundi (Pili means Tiger in Tulu), Kshetrapala, Raktheshwari 
          and Doomavathy.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/desc1.jpg" width="150" height="200" align="left" hspace="5"><font size="2">The 
          Lingam of Shri Somanatheshwara has been made out of pure Saligrama and 
          is considered very sacred. The Lingam has been built as Ardhanareeshwara. 
          There are other artifacts in and around the temple which are pointers 
          to the past glory of this place. Among them are the <b>“Arasule Mancha”</b> 
          <i>(King’s seat)</i>, <b>“Arasule Mantapa”</b> <i>(King’s abode)</i> 
          and the <b>“Jina Vigraha”</b> <i>(Jain Statue)</i>. The temple of Shri 
          Mahaganapati has been rebuilt recently and is splendid in itself.</font></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The most beautiful 
          aspect of the temple is the Cave. Apart from the cave, of course, there 
          are numerous other places surrounding the temple which are worth visiting. 
          To the east of the temple’s entrance is the Amblattapadavu hillock. 
          This hillock is about 300-500 feet high and offers a splendid scenery 
          from the top. One can spot places such as the Bajpe Airport, Mangalore, 
          Panambur, the MRPL refinery and Suratkal. On a day with clear skies, 
          one can even spot the Arabian Sea. Amblattapadavu offers a wonderful 
          view of sunrise and sunset everyday.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <b>“Nagappa 
          Kere”</b> <i>(Snake Pond)</i> is a small pond situated to the north 
          of the temple. This natural pond, along with its religious significance, 
          is also a scenic spot. All devotees who want to enter the cave temple 
          have to clean themselves by taking bath in this pond and only then are 
          they allowed into the cave. The lake is at its best immediately after 
          the monsoons<i> (Oct—Dec)</i> when its crystal clear water is a swimmer’s 
          delight. There are plans to build a small herbal park around this pond 
          as also a small deer park.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <b>“Arasule 
          Mancha”</b> or King’s seat is situated near the main entrance of the 
          temple towards the north. Historical evidence suggests that this seat 
          was where the king of the land used to be seated when he visited the 
          temple. It is believed that even today, the spirits of the former rulers 
          visits the place at night and so it is prohibited to sit on the seat 
          after dusk.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Nellitheertha 
          temple is a symbol of secularism. The temple and the cave is open to 
          members of all beliefs and castes. Any person, above the age of 5, is 
          allowed to enter the cave irrespective of gender. Truly, Nellitheertha 
          is a special and model place.</font></p>
