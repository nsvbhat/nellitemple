          a narration of the story that led to the creation of the temple at Nellitheertha. 
          Many of the incidents here can be linked to the rituals and customs 
          being followed in the temple even to this day.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>When Adharma 
          Reared Its Ugly Head </b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the early part 
          of Kali-Yuga, according to the rules of time, Adharma (evil) started 
          to show its ugly head all over the world. This became especially rampant 
          in �Parashurama Kshetra� where lawlessness, murder, robbery, disregard 
          for God became the order of the day and the lives of ordinary people 
          became miserable. Just when things were getting completely out of control, 
          Sage Narada, who is always working for world peace, decided it was time 
          for some divine intervention and met Lord Shri Maha Vishnu, the proliferator 
          of Dharma on this land. Lord Maha Vishnu consulted Lord Parameshwara 
          (Shiva) and came to a conclusion on the action plan for restoration 
          of Dharma on earth. Accordingly, under the stewardship of Lord Vishnu�s 
          vehicle Vasuki (Nagaraj or Snake God), Lord Shiva�s ganas (assistants) 
          or Bhootas namely Raktheshwari, Kshetrapala, Nandigona, Varahi, Barbaraka 
          and Paashaanamurthy were sent to earth to operate from Parashurama Kshetra 
          which stretched from the north of River Phalguni to the east of River 
          Nandini.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Vasuki and the Ganas 
          came to Parashurama Kshetra and settled down in a beautiful place called 
          as Nagavana (snake forest). Here they tried to promulgate Dharma and 
          Bhakti among the people for some time. But whether it was the influence 
          of time or the effect of the land, the Ganas gradually changed and became 
          arrogant and egoistic. They came under the false belief that they were 
          mightier than Eshwara (God) himself and this reflected upon their activities 
          which ventured off the path of Dharma. Adharma started to rise again.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images/orig.jpg" width="350" height="263" align="left" hspace="5"><b>Maharshi 
          Jabali </b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The great Sage Jabali 
          was performing penance for world peace on the banks of the river Bhagirathi 
          near a place called Thataaka. One day, Sage Narada approached him and 
          asked him thus �O Sage Jabali! What is the purpose of this penance? 
          What do you want to achieve? On the one hand, you have been responsible 
          for the proliferation of evil forces and here on the other hand, you 
          are performing penance for world peace. This dual strategy of yours 
          really perplexes me�. Sage Jabali was surprised at the comments of Sage 
          Narada and asked him �O Great Sage Narada! You work for world peace 
          day and night and are aware of everything. What then is the reason for 
          such comments from you? Since both our intentions are the same, wouldn�t 
          straight talk be more appropriate here?� Sage Narada replied thus �That 
          demon Arunasura upon whom you so kindly bestowed your blessings and 
          advised the Gayathri Mantra (the most sacred mantra for Hindus�which 
          carries the essence of the Vedas), is now using the same for the destruction 
          of Dharma on earth. Evil forces are gaining ground on earth and Bhakti 
          is coming down. Unethical and immoral activities are increasing day 
          by day. Because of the power of the Gayathri Mantra, even the Trimurties 
          (the holy trinity of the Hindus�Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva) are also powerless 
          to destroy him�. This update from Sage Narada put Sage Jabali in a worry. 
          He said �Sage Narada! Please advise me on a way to end this menace�. 
          To this, Sage Narada replied �O Maharshi! Just as you were responsible 
          for the rise of Arunasura, so you shall also be responsible for his 
          downfall. Though this may sound paradoxical, it is Bhagavat-Sankalpa 
          (divine-decision). Therefore, you please proceed to Parashurama Kshetra 
          and perform penance for pleasing Lord Shakti on the banks of the river 
          Nandini. Lord Shakti alone can destroy Arunasura. There is a place called 
          Nagavana near river Nandini which is ideally suited for your mission�. 
          Sage Jabali agreed to this and also indicated that he would take along 
          river Ganga along with him for this purpose. Having triggered the destruction 
          of evil, Sage Narada wished that all ends well and proceeded.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Jabali prays 
          to Ganga and Lord Shiva</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sage Jabali performed 
          penance and Mother Ganga appeared before him fully pleased with his 
          penance. Sage Jabali explained his mission of having to go to Parashurama 
          Kshetra and requested Ganga to join him in this holy mission. Having 
          listened to Sage Jabali�s plea, Ganga replied thus �O Noble Sage! I 
          fully admire your concern for societal health and well being. But I 
          am helpless. I have certain problems because of which I will not be 
          able to accompany you right away. Are you aware of them? Earlier, when 
          Vasundhara was unable to handle my flow, Lord Shiva had to provide shelter 
          to me in his locks. In the same way, South India cannot handle the severity 
          of my flow. But I cannot disappoint devotees like you. Therefore, I 
          will suggest a way out of this. If you sit down and perform penance 
          to please Lord Shiva for your activities, I promise that I shall appear 
          there as Antar-Ganga (appearing from underground). Thus I shall make 
          the land holy.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sage Jabali was 
          immensely pleased and performed penance to please Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva 
          was very pleased and appeared before the Sage. He said �O Maharshi! 
          Though it is a well established fact that Adharma abounds in Kali-Yuga, 
          it sometimes gets out of hand. It is our duty to destroy such evil and 
          protect Dharma. The destruction of those evil forces which is not possible 
          either through the power of boons or through the power of mantras is 
          possible through strategy and planning alone. Arunasura has pleased 
          Lord Shakti through the power of the Gayathri Mantra thus making his 
          destruction an impossible task for us�. Hearing this, Sage Jabali was 
          shaken a bit. He pleaded thus �Lord! What is the way out of this maze? 
          There is no way that peace can be established on earth if Arunasura 
          is not destroyed�. Lord Shiva took mercy and spoke thus �Jabali! If 
          you are ready to lead this effort, I am ready to help you in this. Listen. 
          You, along with Ganga, proceed immediately to Nagavana in Parashurama 
          Kshetra. There is a beautiful cave at that place. Perform severe penance 
          in the cave and please Lord Shakti. If she is pleased with you, your 
          wishes will come true. In order to protect you and to ensure that your 
          penance is not disturbed, I shall send along two of my Ganas with you. 
          Vyaghra Chamundi and Doomavathy shall accompany you�.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images/orig1.jpg" width="350" height="233" align="right" hspace="5"><b>Jabali 
          reaches Nagavana</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Upon receiving Sage 
          Narada�s advice and Lord Shiva�s order and having realized that both 
          of them had suggested that Shri Shakti is alone the way out for this 
          problem, it dawned upon Sage Jabali that the time for appeasement of 
          Shakti had arrived. He traveled southward along with Shiva�s ganas and 
          reached a forest which was full of Bilva trees. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sage Jabali was 
          amazed at what he saw. He was astounded at the marvelous site of the 
          cave. Beautiful trees, creeps and flowers adorned the entire area. The 
          sweet voices of the birds, the peaceful co-existence of animals and 
          the aroma of the forest immensely pleased the Sage. He found great spiritual 
          solace at the place. His determination to succeed in the cause as also 
          the devotion in his heart for the Lord increased manifold. Sage Jabali 
          quickly realized that this was the place suggested by the Lord and decided 
          to perform severe penance at this very spot.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the same spot, 
          Vasuki and the other ganas of Shiva had been residing since a long time. 
          Kshetrapala, who saw these strangers occupying the place, fell suspicious 
          and immediately reported the matter to Vasuki. The arrogant Vasuki did 
          not think over the matter and immediately ordered his assistants Raktheshwari, 
          Varahi, Nandigona, Barbaraka and Paashanamurthy to interrogate the strangers 
          on the matter.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Vyaghra Chamundi 
          (also known as Pili-Chamundi in Tulu language) saw the Bhootas approaching 
          them. He smelt a craving for war in their intentions. He stopped them 
          midway and said �O Bhootas! We are no different from you people. Our 
          intentions are quite similar to yours. We have also been sent by Lord 
          Shiva to establish Dharma on this land. Since you are also residing 
          here with the same intentions, what is the need for an altercation between 
          us. You have forgotten your duty and become arrogant under the influence 
          of power. Get over the veil of ego that has engulfed and join hands 
          with us in restoring truth on this land�. Upon listening to this request 
          from Pili-Chamundi, reality dawned upon Raktheshwari and Kshetrapala 
          and they immediately became assistants to the Sage. <b>(Even to this 
          day, services are offered to Raktheshwari and Kshetrapala in the form 
          of Nemas and Parvas).</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But no such changes 
          took place in Varahi, Nandigona, Barbaraka and Paashanamurthy. They 
          attacked Doomavathy and Vyaghra Chamundi. A fierce war ensued and Doomavathy 
          and Pili-Chamundi reached the brink of defeat. At this stage, Sage Jabali 
          himself stepped in. The Bhootas were no match for the divine power of 
          the Sage. They were defeated and they ran back to Vasuki. The arrogant 
          Vasuki himself came to war with Jabali. He had lost his sense of reason 
          and was incapable of judging the greatness of the Sage. He spoke ill 
          of the Sage and disrespected him. This enraged Sage Jabali and he said 
          �O Nagaraj! You forget the divinity of Hari and Hara. You are discounting 
          us and our intentions of world peace. I hereby curse you that you shall 
          have no existence on earth�.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Vasuki was shocked 
          at the curse. The cloud of ignorance that had blocked his senses waned 
          off. Reality dawned upon him. He prostrated before the Sage and begged 
          for forgiveness for himself and the other ganas. Seeing Vasuki realize 
          his mistake and purify himself in the fire of repentance, the Sage�s 
          anger vanished and he took mercy on him. Sage Jabali said �O Vasuki! 
          What can I do. A Sage�s curse can never be revoked. But it can definitely 
          be altered. Your existence has been destroyed by a Brahmin�s anger. 
          But in due time, Lord Parameshwara will make this place his abode and 
          will appear here in the form of a Lingam. Further, devotees will build 
          a beautiful temple for him here. When poojas, yaganas and other practices 
          as prescribed by Dharma start happening here again, you shall gain your 
          existence back again�. Vasuki and the other ganas felt happy at this 
          and joined hands with the rest of them to aid in establishing Dharma.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sage Jabali entered 
          the cave and was astounded by its beauty. He proceeded towards the inside 
          of the temple fully enjoying the natural beauty of the landscape. As 
          promised, River Ganga appeared there from within and started flowing. 
          Sage Jabali said �Ganga flows from Lord Shiva�s head. Ganga flows from 
          Kashi. And now, Ganga flows in Nagavana. O Lord! No one can predict 
          your divine intentions�. At that moment, Lord Shiva appeared inside 
          the cave in the form of a Lingam. Seeing all this happen, Sage Jabali 
          felt a great energy flow within him and he sat down to perform penance 
          to please Lord Adi Shakti.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images/orig2.jpg" width="350" height="284" align="left" hspace="5"><b>Developments 
          at Ekaveeradripura </b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At Ekaveeradripura, 
          Arunasura was ruling the land according to his Rakshasa Dharma. His 
          rule was evil and he was a terror for his citizens. Earlier, he had 
          obtained the Gayathri Mantra from Sage Jabali and had used it to please 
          Lord Adi Shakti. He had obtained a boon from Lord Adi Shakti that he 
          cannot be killed even by the Trimurtis. Using that boon, he had conquered 
          Swarga, Martya and Patala lokas (Heaven, Earth and the Nether lands).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As per the wishes 
          of the divine, Sage Narada, who is constantly working towards establishment 
          of Dharma, realized that the time to put an end to Arunasura had arrived 
          and that he had a role to play in it. He approached Arunasura�s palace. 
          The demon welcomed Sage Narada and offered him all the obliterations. 
          The demon asked the Sage thus �O Maharshi! I am blessed by your arrival. 
          Please do let me know the reason for your visit�. Sage Narada laughed 
          and said �Arunasura! I took pity upon seeing your ignorance and decided 
          to visit you. I am sure I can call you a fool going by your actions�. 
          This made Arunasura angry and he said �O Narada! Instead of pricking 
          me with your skeptical statements, please come straight to the point 
          and help me clarify the doubts in my mind�. Sage Narada said �O King 
          of the Rakshasas! There is a fire burning in your palace and you are 
          still unaware of it. That very person who advised you on the Gayathri 
          Mantra is now working overtime to ensure your destruction. Sage Jabali 
          is performing a severe penance at Nagavana and he is trying to please 
          Lord Shakti. Do not delay even a little. Proceed immediately to stop 
          his penance. Else, your end is guaranteed�.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Arunasura was outraged 
          listening to this story and he immediately ordered two of his trusted 
          lieutenants�Chanda and Prachanda to proceed towards Nagavana and spoil 
          Sage Jabali�s penance. Chanda and Prachanda took along a huge army with 
          them and attacked Nagavana. A fierce battle ensued between the Rakshasas 
          and the Bhootas. The Rakshasas reached the brink of defeat and retreated. 
          But soon, they came back like waves of the ocean. This time they were 
          under the leadership of Arunasura himself. They completely surrounded 
          Nagavana. This alerted Kshetrapala and he realized the gravity of the 
          situation. He immediately entered the cave and spoke to Sage Jabali��O 
          Lord! A fierce war is happening between us and Arunasura�s army. At 
          any time now, the Rakshasas may enter the cave and put an end to your 
          penance. Therefore, you please proceed towards the east using the secret 
          exit in the cave. There you please perform the Chandika Yagna (the biggest 
          and grandest yagna for Lord Shakti) and appease Lord Shakti�.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sage Jabali�s mind 
          was at the crossroads. On one side was the impending trouble from the 
          Rakshasas, on the other hand Lord Adi Shakti had not yet appeared. And 
          then there was the suggestion from Kshetrapala. Under pressure, Sage 
          Jabali meditated and thought for a while. It dawned upon the Sage that 
          if Lord Adi Shakti wished to appear only through the Chandika Yagna, 
          then that has to be the adopted route. So, as per directions from Kshetrapala, 
          Sage Jabali exits the cave and reaches a place called Mallikavana. Finding 
          it an equally beautiful place, Sage Jabali decides to peform the Yagna 
          there. The Trimurtis, the Devas and the Bhootas stand as guards for 
          the Yagna.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Upon not finding 
          Sage Jabali inside the cave, Arunasura is very agitated and thinks he 
          has been cheated by Sage Narada. He starts indiscriminately killing 
          Rishis and Sages as revenge. His end is nearing!!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images/orig3.jpg" width="350" height="233" align="right" hspace="5"><b>Adi 
          Shakti Obliges!</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The yagna being 
          performed at Mallikavana had no match in history. It was a litmus test 
          for the devotion of Sage Jabali. It was a yagna being performed for 
          world peace. Right at the time of the Poornahuti (the offering towards 
          the completion of the yagna), Lord Adi Shakti appeared right at the 
          middle of the fire with a pleasant smile on her face. When asked the 
          reason for the yagna, Sage Jabali narrated the entire story and pleaded 
          for her intervention. Lord Adi Shakti said �O Devotees! Let there be 
          no fear. This day has come upon us because of the mistake of advising 
          a Rakshasa with the Gayathri Mantra without giving a thought to the 
          gravity of the consequence of such an action. But he has acted according 
          to his birth qualities. Even then, he is my true devotee. He has been 
          worshipping me every day with complete devotion. Hence I shall create 
          a separate environment where he will reach the brink of his bad deeds. 
          Near a place called Kati on the banks of the river Nandini, I shall 
          take the form of a Brahmari (bee) and kill him. <b>(This sacred place 
          is now called Kateel where Lord Adi Shakti took the form of a bee and 
          killed Arunasura. The God is worshipped as Lord Durgaparameshwari here. 
          It is one of the most sacred places of South India). �</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lord Shakti continued 
          addressing her devotees �O Parameshwara! You may reside at the place 
          where Sage Jabali performed penance. Appear there in the form of a Lingam 
          and bless the devotees with their wishes <b>(This place is Nagavana 
          or Nellitheertha where Lord Shiva resides as Lord Shri Somanatheshwara).</b> 
          O Ganga! You may flow in the cave for six months a year and help people 
          get rid of their sins. You may get back to Kashi for the other six months. 
          Let this place be called as Dakshina Kashi (Kashi of the South). O Vishnu! 
          You may appear in the nearby place called Kovalapura and bless the devotees 
          <b>(This place, called Kompadavu, is close to Nellitheertha and has 
          a beautiful Vishnu temple).</b> Since the holy Chandika Yagna was performed 
          at Mallikavana, I shall appear there in the form of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi 
          and Mahasaraswathi and shall bless all those who pray to me <b>(This 
          place, called Mucchur, is adjoining Nellitheertha).</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This same place 
          Nagavana, due to the goose berry shaped water drops falling from the 
          roof of the cave, came to be known as Nelli-Theertha (Gooseberry-Holy 
          water). It is believed that Sages and gods occupy the cave for six months 
          and hence, even to this day, humans are allowed to enter the cave only 
          six months a year (from October to April).</font></p>
