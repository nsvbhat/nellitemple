        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The main attraction 
          of the temple is the cave. Situated right at the entrance of the temple 
          towards the left of the main door, this huge cave is one of nature's 
          wonders. Unspoilt by human indulgence, the cave is a nature lover's 
          delight. A visit to the inside of the cave is considered a sacred and 
          spiritual experience by devotees. The entrance to the cave is huge and 
          wide. Within a few feet, the trail narrows down and one is forced to 
          bend and crawl forward. Subsequently, one has to fall flat on the tummy 
          and crawl ahead. Finally, after about 300-400 metres, the cave widens 
          again and we find a huge lake in there. There is a natural Shiva Lingam 
          in front of the lake and devotees pray and worship the lingam. The most 
          amazing part of the cave is the fine quality of the mud available inside. 
          It is said that the mud here has healing powers and is treated as prasadam 
          by devotees. Right behind the Shiva Lingam, a second cave starts off. 
          Not many people have ventured into this second cave till date. A few 
          who have gone ahead vouch for the extreme terrain they have encountered. 
          It surely will be challenging for the adventure lovers.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/cave.jpg" width="350" height="233" align="right" hspace="5"><font size="2">The 
          name Nellitheertha also has its etymological roots in the cave. Inside 
          of the cave, drops of water, in the shape of amla (gooseberries) constantly 
          keep dripping down. In fact, the lake is made up of these drops of water. 
          Hence the name Nelli (Amla) Theertha (holy water). Another unique aspect 
          of the cave is that it is closed for nearly 6 months a year. The cave 
          is open only between October and April. Though there are religious reasons 
          associated with this (it is said that the cave is open 6 months a year 
          for humans and is meant for Gods and Rishis the remaining 6 months), 
          the point is that the 6 month break each year helps the cave to "rejuvenate". 
          The water freshens up and the animals inside enjoy the lack of disturbance. 
          Yes, there are plenty of animals inside the cave. Most common among 
          them are snakes (of all varieties), scorpions, porcupines and thousands 
          of bats. These are considered sacred and troubling or hurting the animals 
          in any manner is strictly forbidden.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Legend also has 
          it that Maharshi (Saint) Jabali used this cave as his abode. Hence the 
          name Jabaleshwara for the presiding deity. It is believed that Maharshi 
          Jabali performed Tapas (penance) here to Lord Durgaparameshwari to request 
          her to kill Arunasura (a demon). It is said that Sri Durga acceeded 
          to Jabali's request and destroyed Arunasura at Kateel (another fabulous 
          and famous temple town - very close to Nellitheertha). There is a spot 
          inside the cave which is widely believed to be where Maharshi Jabali 
          perfomed his Tapas.</font></p>
